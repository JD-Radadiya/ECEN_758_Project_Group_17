\begin{abstract}
This project explores the application of data mining techniques for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items, serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to develop robust models capable of accurately classifying these images, thereby demonstrating the practical utility of data mining for image classification.

\section{Introduction}
The field of data mining has witnessed substantial advancements, particularly in image classification tasks. Image classification and object detection have become central components of discerning intricate patters from images \cite{Ksaraswat2023ImageClassification}. The Fashin MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of Zalando's clothing items in 10 label categories categories and is widely used as benchmark that replaces the original MNIST dataset of handwritten digits \cite{Xiao2017FashionMNIST}. The training and test data consist of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images, respectively. Each image of the entire dataset was labeled with one of ten categories: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
The significance of this project lies in its potential applications within the fashion industry, such as inventory management, recommendation systems, and trend analysis. By leveraging the Fashion MNIST dataset, we aim to apply and compare various data mining techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), to classify images accurately.

\subsection{Dataset Overview}
The Fashion MNIST dataset's uniform structure and standardized format make it ideal for training and testing machine learning models. Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a consistent input size for various algorithms.
